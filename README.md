All this does is use two hooks for state keeping.

One used for Login and the other for keeping track of the financials between the Account and the Teller so components share variables(state) between each other.


Learning outcomes:

React has 101 ways of obtaining the same result bar one or two.

I find that I tried both class based methods and functional ones, I prefered functional originally because of the hooks but the re-rendering is such a pain in the ass.

Next time I will re-write the whole thing in classes, yes its a pain too but theres abit more flexibility when it comes to state.

I found this idea of removing logic from the frontend of React components a harder thing to obtain because it almost wants you to have the logic built-in anyway.

Lastly, what the heck is Redux. That's all together a mad library which is why for a simple project like this I found it overkill.

Thanks guys for the lessons I took away many.
